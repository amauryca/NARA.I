for emotion recognition a.i., it want it to act like a therapist, that analyzes your behavior, based on facial recognition, vocal tone, and content being spoken. it then speaks back to you through a.i. first, the therapist toggle for emotion ai goes out of place, fix the toggle so that it displays well. Second, emotion ai should be the only one speaking, not chatbot. Emotion A.I. is having an error loading A.I. models, fix it please.So no a.i works. The therapeutic A.I. isnt responsive and the Chatbot isnt responding properly using gemini responses. and i cant select my age group so that any a.i. adapts to my age to respond correctly. The age group should correspond throughout each a.i. As well as how the Therapeutic A.i. Should work in real time. I need it to be free, use a free alternative for anthropic. using my gemini api key: AIzaSyAkFJjQBTAoAHfxG9mtQbqr70njMip4lpQ
